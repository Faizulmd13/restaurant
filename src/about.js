  aboutDesc.textContent = `Maaran Parotta Shop began as a dream of bringing
        authentic South Indian flavors to our beloved neighborhood. Founded in
        2010 by the Maaran family, who have been making parotta for generations,
        our shop has become a favorite spot for locals and visitors alike. Our
        commitment to authenticity extends beyond our recipes. We use
        traditional methods to prepare our parotta, using only the finest
        ingredients like stone-ground atta, fresh ghee, and hand-pounded spices.
        Our curries are made with love, using time-honored recipes passed down
        through our family. The shop's warm and welcoming atmosphere reflects
        our philosophy that food should be a celebration of home, family, and
        tradition. Our rustic d√©cor, the aroma of freshly cooked parotta, and
        the friendly service create a cozy experience that feels like a visit to
        a traditional South Indian kitchen.`;
